            Starting from the late 20th century we have been taught the importance of collaboration in organization. As Steve Jobs famously said: “Creativity is connecting the dots”. 
            There is no doubt that the idea of people coming together has tremendous amounts of benefits for an organization in  ways that it contributes to the democracy inside of the company, 
            improvement of ideas by challenging them, and overall, as a rule of thumb, two minds far better than one. Surprisingly, every good idea that is being implemented in a mainstream culture starts to be 
            misused and/or misinterpreted.
        </p>
        <p>
            Religions contributed the equality and morality of human beings towards the nature and other species until religious leaders started to put benefits of themselves above anything else, democracy 
            contributed the equality between government and nation until populists started to use it in their own gains, communism, at first, aimed to get the basic rights of working class people stronger in order 
            to prevent violations of laws by employers until leaders started to misuse it and ignore the issues with it again for their own benefits, and of course, capitalism that made our economy efficient by 
            bringing price signals and profit maximization throughout times became a cult that pursues profits and efficiency over nature and harmony.
        </p>
        <p>
            Because we will use the word “collaboration” more than few times, we need to define it. Collaboration is the situation of two or more people working together to create or achieve the same thing. [Opinion based] The two main purposes of collaboration: 
            <ul>
                <ol>Increase efficiency.</ol>
                <ol>Increase productivity.</ol>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            So what happened with idea of collaboration? Since, I consider meetings as a part of the collaboration, the first problem is quantity of meetings. And because quantity diminishes quality 
            (link to life worth learning) these number of meetings are not necessarily contribute towards to productivity and efficiency. If the collaboration is not making an organization more efficient and 
            productive, in my opinion, it violates its main principles and eliminates the main benefits. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Thus, we need to value time of employees and only organize meetings when people’s input are needed. What kind of inputs are the case: instant feedback to announcements, group thinking, giving ideas to 
            solve a particular problem.        
        </p>
        <p>
            However, as we go deeper through the problem, we can see that the problem is not only about the quantity but also how these meeting are arranged which is the second problem with meetings. But we divide
            this problem to 2 different sub-problems. The first one is authoritarian leadership that forces employees to collaborate.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let me be clear. The least thing that I want is to bubble a problem with loud words and give only one side perspective. But the thing is, many organizations, where employees have no unions, are run as authoritarian 
            regime where a word of a CEO or any other manager is much of a rule and a command than a statement that is open to discuss. For people who thinks that it is only possible in undeveloped and undemocratic countries, 
            <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2018/09/18/the-human-api-manifesto/">Jeff Bezos’s 2002 memo</a> and Jason Fired’s memo about <a href="https://world.hey.com/jason/changes-at-basecamp-7f32afc5">new policies in Basecamp's culture</a> 
            can be a good example of it happening in democratic and developed country. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I am not saying that authoritarian leadership is totally wrong. It has its own benefits in particular situations. But it is not a case with meetings. 
            Because concept of authoritarian leadership implies that there is downward influence[The ability to influence those in positions lower than yours.] where executive managers tell their visions and managers 
            try to interpret and implement them. Sometimes they do it blindly. It leads situations where people with certain personalities are being forced to collaborate and punished for not doing so. As a consequence, 
            workers are collaborating because of fear and with no willingness. And what happens when people do things they do not want to do? Crappy and low quality of results which probably would be re-worked on again in the 
            future. Of course, there is a chance that everybody will be happy to meet and work on a task together but my observations on different subreddits [It is a web forum of a particular topic where you can post links 
            or create a self post and discuss. You can subscribe if you like that topic or you can unsubscribe if you dont.] tells me that it is not a case in majority of situations.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to solve this problem two approaches can be considered.
            <ul>
                <ol>Letting employees to choose whether they want to participate in meetings and collaborations by considering a value that they can add to them. It is Elon Musk’s one of the tips for <a href="https://electrek.co/2018/04/17/tesla-model-3-production-goal-6000-units-per-week/">increasing productivity</a> and he even suggests to walk out of a meeting or drop off a call as soon as it is obvious you aren’t adding value. </ol>
                <ol>Healthy conflicts. According to Priya Parker, depending on the type of the meeting we can get full from meetings by creating a healthy conflicts. It also heals the unhealthy peace where participants of the meeting are afraid of telling their opinion. To boost competitiveness of the problem solving challenges, employees can be divided into groups and decide what is better way of solving problems No matter which team wins, everyone who participates in the problem-solving collaboration will get bonuses at the end of the months but the winning team gets higher bonuses. It will encourage people both to participate and contribute as much as they can to make better ideas and win.</ol>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Even after solving the problem with gathering people with different personality with their own curiosity and interest we will have the second sub-problem with arrangement of meetings: 
            meetings are loaded full of tasks which can be done individually before or after the meetings.
        </p>
        <p>
            That is far more simple to explain. Have you ever been in a meeting where a leader of the meeting is reading reports during the meeting to just give a feedback? Or meeting when the leader tells employees 
            to think about a particular problem during the meeting? These two examples give good picture of what kind of tasks I am talking about when defining the sub-problem. Can the employer read the reports 
            before the meeting or tell the problem that will be discussed at least one day before the meeting? There is no doubt that it is doable. By doing some tasks in this way, hosts of meetings can save good 
            amount of time of their own and others too.
        </p>
        <p>
            To elaborate on further solutions regarding this problem managers before starting the meetings put the list what kind of tasks will be done during every part of an agenda. Do the tasks that can be done before the meeting. Characteristics of these kind of tasks are:
            <ul>
                <ol>When doing the tasks everyone except one person is taking no action in the process.</ol>
                <ol>When it can give participants of the meeting more time and space to think about it.</ol>
            </ul>
            In addition to that, managers can put time constraints in order to be efficient. For example, managers can put the rule that the meeting should not exceed 30 minutes and always follow it.
        </p>
        <p>
            We probably would solve the some problems with this hypothetical solution which also may not work at all depending on the type of company culture. But it is a job of managers from this point.
