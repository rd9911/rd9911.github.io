### TLDR
The book is about how fast growing startups use the same fundamental principles over and over, and reach success.

### The core idea
The core idea lies on the term blitzscaling (**) which is taken from German military forces' strategy during WWII. The strategy is simple: *prioratize a speed over efficiency*. He argues that in series of startups proved the idea of prioratizing the speed over efficiency and winning the market. The question is how, and when to do it. Since building a fast-growing startup is not a science, those two questions are answered by considering different variables e.g strategy, industry, business model, location. 

### I would recommend this book to ...
Anybody who is leading an organization, a team, or building a product no matter how big or small it is. Because at any point we would like to have an opinion of people who has been through the problems we are seeing, and this is a great chance to get those experiences and advices without even connecting to storyholders.
