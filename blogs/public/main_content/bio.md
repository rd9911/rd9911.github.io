I am a self-taught web-developer with 2 years of experience specialized in React.js and node.js ecosystem. For my formal education in Finance, I frequently analyze data with the help of python packages (numpy, pandas, scikit learn, matplotlib). 

### Working experience
During the coding journey, I had my formal education and I had been working in a kindergarten by teaching 5-11 years old kids to speak, read, write in English as well as science and creativity. Saying that teaching kids is difficult would be easy. But in most of the days, within the process of teaching young kids, I learned a lot of things that can be useful in my future career and personal life.
