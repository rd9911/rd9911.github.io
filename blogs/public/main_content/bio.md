I am a self-taught web-developer with 2 years of experience specialized in React.js and node.js ecosystem. For my formal education in Finance, I frequently analyze data with the help of python packages (numpy, pandas, scikit learn, matplotlib). Since I am not born with talents, I work hard to perform as much as top talented performers do. Fot me it is a feature, not a bug sicne while talented people wait their inspiration I get the job done. 

I have a passion for building new technologies and their applications in different fields. It is great combination of informal education (self-taught developer) and formal one (finance) since together they consider solving problems of people with an aim of profitability from the day one.


### Backstory
I am an ordinary guy from odinary family in Central Asia. I was not blessed with special talents from the birth. I was blessed with my family since they taught me by showing how hard work can get you through the life and even reach your dreams. I always needed to work 2x-10x harder to perform above average in any skills. Still, it was not enough to outperform talented peers That's why, I lost my motivation in education pretty fast. After a trip to Malaysia and China, I decided that my needs are:
- [ ]  to travel the world
- [ ]  to take opportunities
- [ ]  challenge myself
- [ ]  realize on what I will spend my life. 

In 2019, I have learned English from 0 to B2 level and at the age of 18 I moved to South Korea to study Business Administration. Soon, I have realized that a lot of mistakes were made after this decision. Some of them that I can remember are:
- did not learn culture before moving
- did not learn the local language before moving
- did not make local friends after moving

Fortunately, in 2021, when I moved to Finland, I learned the culture of Finn people, a bit of Finnish language, and made a lot of wonderful friends!
- [x]  to travel the world

### Breakthrough
In Spring 2020 semester, I took 'Automation and Robotics in Korean Industries' course because it was the only elective course that was not overlapping in a schedule with my other core courses. Over the semester, Professor Jason Reeve showed taught us about technologies of now and the future. Building Arduino robots, learning about Korean automakers trying to reach autonomy levels 4 and 5, neuroscience empowering our brains to work better, neuromorphic computers breaking the Moore's Law, autonomous and humanoid robots changing, and, of course, Artificial Intelligence that is becoming backbone of our world. 

I fell in love with technologies that I saw and decided that my life will be spent to build a company(ies) that are empowered by technologies that will matter for humanity most in the long term. What is the main skill for a broke student to build a prodcut? Coding.

Within the next 5-6 months after coding 5-7 hours/day, I have finished Codecademy's Computer Science career path. The course gave me a solid knowledge of python, and introduced me to Algorithms and Data Structures by doing projects. Then, came the time of uncertainity. Too many stacks, too many frameworks, too many opportunities. That is the reason, I have started leaning Django but gave up when I started Odin Project which also was given up because of awesome content of Full Stack Web Development course by University of Helsinki. I stuck to this course for 8 months and completed 9 parts of it. It gave me real understanding of how products are built and opened a path to software engineering. 

However, more I learn more I started to understand how little do I know about the world of startups. So I decided to work for companies for a couple years to apply my knowledge in massive products and observe internally how companies work.


### Working experience
During the coding journey, I had my formal education and I had been working in a kindergarten by teaching 5-11 years old kids to speak, read, write in English as well as science and creativity. Saying that teaching kids is difficult would be easy to day. But in most of the days, within the process of teaching young adults, I learned a lot of things that can be useful in my future career and personal life. 

For example, I understood that in order to learn something I need to start teaching it. By getting instant feedback from how kids perceived the information, I could understand how well I learned the topic. Moreover, I have got some knowledge of why education systems in a lot of countries are so bad. A low ratio of educators per student, a lack of willingness to change ways how they teach depending on the class which mostly caused by low wages and almost no usage of data, or students are just jerks which is one of the reasons of why teachers have low motivation to teach them!

### Goals
My main goal is to make my family happy, and provide better edcuation for young people, for a much lower price. A more selfish goal is to build a company that will help people (and the world overall) and outlast me in this mortal life. In this journey I will educate myself for a new thing everyday in order to pursue a perfectness that is impossible to achieve.
