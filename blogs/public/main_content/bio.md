I am a self-taught web-developer with 2 years of experience specialized in React.js and node.js ecosystem. For my formal education in Finance, I frequently analyze data with the help of python packages (numpy, pandas, scikit learn, matplotlib). Since I am not born with talents, I work hard to perform as much as top talented performers do. Fot me it is a feature, not a bug sicne while talented people wait their inspiration I get the job done. 

I have a passion for building new technologies and their applications in different fields. It is great combination of informal education (self-taught developer) and formal one (finance) since together they consider solving problems of people with an aim of profitability from the day one.

### Working experience
During the coding journey, I had my formal education and I had been working in a kindergarten by teaching 5-11 years old kids to speak, read, write in English as well as science and creativity. Saying that teaching kids is difficult would be easy to day. But in most of the days, within the process of teaching young adults, I learned a lot of things that can be useful in my future career and personal life. 

For example, I understood that in order to learn something I need to start teaching it. By getting instant feedback from how kids perceived the information, I could understand how well I learned the topic. Moreover, I have got some knowledge of why education systems in a lot of countries are so bad. A low ratio of educators per student, a lack of willingness to change ways how they teach depending on the class which mostly caused by low wages and almost no usage of data, or students just do not have any purpose to come and study which is one of the reasons of why teachers have low motivation to teach them!
