    <p>
      I am a student who likes to learn new things and dreams about to leave something after himself. My goal is clear: found a company that will last for hundreds of years and have a good time with my family.
      But before to get there I need to get experience.That's why I am looking for a job.
    </p>
    <h2>What I can do.</h2>
    <h4>Programming.</h4>
    <p>
      I have experience in python programming language and its libraries that are handful in data science: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn (I know it is web-scrapping but I use it to scrap info from websites).
      I would describe my knowledge in python environment as advanced beginner. In addition to that I have better knowledge in web-development with javascript, html, css, node.js, react.js, redux, express.js, graphql.
      In web-development I would describe myself as intermediate level. I know how to google things much efficiently so that it will take much short time and do more coding. 
      Primary sources of learning are codecademy and full stack open educational platforms.
    </p>
    <h4>Finance</h4>
    <p>As my primary major at University is Finance, I have intermediate knowledge in the field. I am familiar with monetery systems, macro and microeconomic theories, statistics, corporate accounting, taxation, valuation of companies and stocks, and managerial accounting</p>
    <h2>What have I done?</h2>
    <p>
      I was an English teacher in a kindergarten in South Korea for 6-7 months. It taught me a lot of things about knowledge, education and, of course, how to deal with group of people who does not listen to you at all.
      Then as my knowldge in programming grew and it got quite interesting, I left the job and started to learn in almost full-time (I did my University assignments when I had spare time).
      I have completed 8 parts of Full Stack Open by University of Helsinki and got an understanding of basic workflow in web-development. Specifically, key components were an understanding how front-end and back-end communicates, APIs, middlewares, basic REST requests and etc.
      Since the course is very practical, all my understanding came from learning while working on a problem. At University I have engaged in 4 projects for real companies as a team leader. The aims of the projects were creating a buisness plan, building a go-to-market strategy.
    </p>
    <h2>What am I learning right now?</h2>
    <p>
      These things are in my to-do list: lienar algebra and calculus to broaden my technical skills, geometry to apply it in visualisation and graphics, media processing to start with computer vision (it is my favorite field), 
      physics to understand how we will colonize the Mars and chemistry because it is really interesting to know how anatomy of creatures work in a molecular level.
    </p>
    <h2>My interests.</h2>
    <p>
      Learning and discussing about philosophy, economics, science, and existence in a deep level. Also I love to watch football and hockey. In my spare time I write blogposts and create educational videos in the topics that I am interested in.
    </p>
    <h2>What am I looking for?</h2>
    <p>
      A job that can give me experience in either finance or programming field that will engage me in challenges that are valuable for a company (not only routine tasks). A company culture that values both collaboration and personal space.
      And a competitive salary that will give me a privelege not to worry about my bills but focus on the job. In an exchange I will give my knowledge and focus on the job and contrbute towards to the company's success.
