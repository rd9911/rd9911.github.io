                    The fundamental, root-of-it-all building block for linear algebra is the vector, so it's \worth making sure that we're all on the same page about what exactly a vector is. You see, broadly speaking there are three distinct but related ideas about vectors, which I'll call the physics student perspective, the computer science student perspective, and the mathematician's perspective.
                    The physics student perspective is that vectors are arrows pointing in space (Figure 1). What defines a given vector is its length, and the direction it's pointing in, but as long as those two facts are the same, you can move it all around and it's still the same vector. Vectors that live in the flat plane are two-dimensional (only back and forth movement (Figure 2)), and those sitting in broader space that you and I live in are three-dimensional (can move back and forth AND up and down (Figure 3)).

                <div>The computer science perspective is that vectors are ordered lists of numbers. For example, let's say that you were doing some analytics about house prices, and the only features you cared about were square footage and price. You might model each house with a pair of numbers Figure 4: the first indicating square footage, and the second indicating price. Figure 5 Notice that the order matters here. In the lingo, you'd be modeling houses as two-dimensional vectors, where in this context, "vector" is pretty much just a fancy word for "list", and what makes it two-dimensional is the fact that the length of that list is 2. Information about house size and price is saved in a vector aka list.</div>

                <div>The mathematician, on the other hand, seeks to generalize both of these views, basically saying that a vector can be anything where there's a sensible notion of adding two vectors, and multiplying a vector by a number, operations that we will discuss later. The details of this view are rather abstract, and it's healthy to ignore it until the last chapter of this course, favoring a more concrete setting in the interim, but the reason that why it is here is that it hints at the fact that ideas of vector addition and multiplication by numbers will play an important role throughout linear algebra.</div>
