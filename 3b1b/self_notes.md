17/04/2021 Current version is totally fail. But since it is been working for 3-4 hours I think it might be okay. There are some sort of things that will be implemented through this weekend and hope that 3Blue1Brown at would see the final version.
Things should be implemented:
-> Make the text in the left hand side of the screen and all visuals on the right hand side.
    -> why? because there are a lot of visuals, paragraphs are too short to and it looks inconsistent. If a person can look at visuals whenever he/she does not understand the text, I think this would interrupt them less.
-> For each outline 1-2 questions about the core idea of the outline at the beginning of the text.
    -> Why? in the book "A mind for numbers" it is said that the technique of asking questions before starting the reading improves our diffuse thinking which is very essential when we understand new topics.
-> Edit the transcript so that it would not look like it was taken from video.
    Why? because in the video there are a lot of time when a speaker pointed to a specific part of the image. But in text based format it should be explained so that they could easily imagine it.
-> Animate some figures.
    -> Why? because there are too many figures and if we could reduce them it would be mor comprehensive for people.
-> Change the font style.
    -> Why? because there is a research that states people understand and focus text better when the font type is different than usual ones that we see everyday life.
